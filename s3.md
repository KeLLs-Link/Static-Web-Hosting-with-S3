___

error 403 Forbidden message recieved because   bucket permissions has not yet been configured. This indicates that the object has been uploaded to amazon s3 but the status of the content of the bucket is private.
You can make Amazon S3 objects public through two different ways:

To make either a whole bucket public or a specific directory in a bucket public, use a bucket policy.

To make individual objects in a bucket public, use an access control list (ACL). It is normally safer to make individual objects public because doing so avoids accidentally making other objects public. However, if you know that the entire bucket contains no sensitive information, you can use a bucket policy.
