___

error 403 Forbidden message recieved because   bucket permissions has not yet been configured. This indicates that the object has been uploaded to amazon s3 but the status of the content of the bucket is private.
You can make Amazon S3 objects public through two different ways:

To make either a whole bucket public or a specific directory in a bucket public, use a bucket policy.

To make individual objects in a bucket public, use an access control list (ACL). It is normally safer to make individual objects public because doing so avoids accidentally making other objects public. However, if you know that the entire bucket contains no sensitive information, you can use a bucket policy.

# Task 4: Turning on public access to the objects

Objects in bucket made public using ACL (Access Control List)

___

After making objects bucket publicly accesible, you should now see the static website that is being hosted by Amazon S3.

# - Task 5: Securely sharing an object using a presigned URL

When you need to temporarily and securely share an object with a person or group of people, you can create a presigned URL Presigned URL helps us to securely and temporarily share files (objects in s3 bucket) with a person or group.
When you create the URL, you must configure how long the URL will be valid. Then, you can share this URL with the users who should have access to the object.

 As long as the presigned URL is valid, anyone who has it can get acces to the object in your bucket. It is a best practice reccomendation to avoid keeping the URL active longer than necessary, and only share the URL with concerned persons.

 Instead of making the newsreport object in the s3 bucket public, a presigned URL to access the file. the time interval until the presigened url expires was set to 1 minute.

# - Task 6: Using a bucket policy to secure your bucket
You want to protect your website files and make sure that no one can delete them. To do this, you apply a bucket policy that denies delete privileges on your website files.
```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Id": "MyBucketPolicy",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "BucketPutDelete",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::<mystaticwebbuckett>/index.html",
				"arn:aws:s3:::<mystaticwebbuckett>/script.js",
				"arn:aws:s3:::<mystaticwebbuckett>/style.css"
        ]
		}
	]
}

```
Object failed to delete after a "deny delete" policy was set.

Effect": "Deny"
```
___
# - Task 7: Updating the website
Although you have configured a policy to prevent deletion of website files, you can still update the website by editing the HTML file and uploading it to the S3 bucket again.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service, so you must upload the whole file. This action replaces the existing object in your bucket. You cannot edit the contents of an object; instead, you must replace the whole object.

# Task 8: Exploring file versions

Bucket versioning is turned off by default. When versioning is turned off, changes to objects can’t be undone. For example, if you upload a new version of a file, the old file is replaced with the new one. The original file is lost. If you delete a file, it is permanently deleted, and you can’t get it back.

However, when versioning is turned on, changed and deleted versions of files are saved. Previous versions of objects are not presented by default, but you can access them using the console or programmatically. Because you are keeping earlier versions of objects, you can recover them if you need to.
